# Oranje (Dutch: Orange)
<i>\*\*I don't think I needed to tell that translation..</i>

### Oranje is a text editor that aims to be a successor to my old editor [whirlEdit](https://github.com/whmsft/whirledit) and also a Refresh of "Thee".

#### This editor aims to be highly moduler, such that

* The executable is a blank tkinter app that runs modules
* Updating and modules controlled by a cli tool
* Modules with priority (for initialization)
